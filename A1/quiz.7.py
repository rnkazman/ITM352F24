# quiz.py - an interactive quiz system, seventh version
# - Make QUESTIONS a dictionary, to include answer options and the correct choice.
# - Allow the user to select the correct answer by its label.
# - Improve the look and usability.  Keep track of correct answers. Loop until a user
#   provides a correct alternative.
# - Randomize the order of questions and order of the answer alternatives per question
# - Refactor the code to use functions
