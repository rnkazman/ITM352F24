# Assignment 1: Create an Interactive Quiz

We will walk through the first few steps of this assignment together, creating a simple quiz game where a user is presented with questions and can provide answers, and we keep score.  

After creating the basic version of the game as a group you will extend the game on your own to add more useful features.

<ol>
<li>Quiz creator: Add a separate application that interactively asks for questions and answers and stores them in the proper JSON format.
<li>Store data in a database: Replace the JSON data file with a proper database.
<li>Question Hub: Create a central questions database online that your application can connect to.
<li>Multiuser challenges: Allow different users to challenge each other in a trivia competition.
